# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/images/background.png
        - assets/images/app_logo.png
        - assets/images/bottomNavigationIcon/
        - assets/images/dropdown/
        - assets/images/busPage/
        - assets/images/homePage/
        - assets/json/190_bus_last.json
        - assets/json/190_bus_departSchool.json
        - assets/images/mealPage/
        - assets/images/CalendarPage/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Pretendard
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Regular.otf

                weight: 100

                weight: 300
              - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard/Pretendard-Medium.otf
